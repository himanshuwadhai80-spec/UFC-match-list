            <p>The <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)</strong> is the world’s leading mixed martial arts (MMA) organization. It features the highest-level athletes competing in a specialized eight-sided enclosure known as the Octagon. The UFC is responsible for professionalizing MMA, turning it from a spectacle of "style vs. style" into a globally recognized sport with strict weight classes, medical testing, and unified rules.</p>

            <p>The UFC was founded by Art Davie and Rorion Gracie and held its first event, <strong>UFC 1</strong>, in Denver, Colorado, on November 12, 1993. The original goal was to determine which martial art was superior in a situation with minimal rules. It was marketed as a "no-holds-barred" tournament.</p>
            <p>In 2001, <strong>Zuffa, LLC</strong> (led by Dana White and the Fertitta brothers) purchased the struggling promotion. They transformed it from a controversial spectacle into a sanctioned, regulated sport by working with athletic commissions to implement the <strong>Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts</strong>. Today, it is the premier MMA organization in the world.</p>
